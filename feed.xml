        <title>Low Latency Labs Launch</title>
        <description>  &lt;p&gt;Why are we waiting? No one ever wished their computer took more time to finish a task.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We launch the Low Latency Laboratory to measure, understand, and minimize network and system latency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Low Latency Laboratory provides a focused venue to allow our work on: the measurement of latency in both computer and networked-systems, the understanding of these measurements, and &lt;!--more--&gt; to announce our efforts to reduce and even entirely mitigate such latency.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Practically, we can not banish latency entirely but we seek to better-understand and reduce the latency that does impact in our computer use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Latency costs us our most precious resource: time. Not only is time valuable at a personal-level, but by removing our ability to choose if and when to wait, the systems we rely-on waste resources thereby increasing the costs to each and everyone of us. In many respects the latency of networks and computer-systems has been a creeping outcome: in some cases a fixed overhead that was previously small enough to leave architects and implementors unconcerned is no longer irrelevant. In other ways increasingly complex systems have had ever-increasing quantities of latency, each small but insidious and significant in total.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/LowLatencyLabs/&quot;&gt;Low Latency Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; seeks an ambitious goal: to remove the impact of latency on our networks and computer-systems. This adventurous objective will be sought by measuring and understanding the many facets of network and system latency all while considering alternative approaches to architecting, engineering, and optimizing network-systems.&lt;/p&gt;
